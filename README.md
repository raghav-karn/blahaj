## Overview ‚ú®
**Dimensions of Bl√•haj** is a Bl√•haj-dedicated landing page, featuring a 3D Bl÷∞√•haj to guide you through. You can learn more about Bl√•haj here!

## How I managed to pull this off üìÉ
> After I joined Hack Club, one of the first things I got to know about was Bl√•haj; and forever since wanted to create a page dedicated to it. Like OMG, it looks so cool. Bummer I cannot get one because of customs ;-;. Anyway, here's the page that was long awaited!

Here is how I managed to do this:
- Created a beautiful landing page with awesome fonts, gradients and an overall elegant look-feel to it.
- Fetched the 3D files off of Sketchfab (new thing I got to learn today, besides working with 3D models for first time because I have never used CAD as well).
- The time consuming part: learning (time consuming, yet fun), making out small nitpicks in design each time and changing stuff

## The fun part ‚Äî Learning! üòã
> Gosh was learning about 3D designs and 3D websites was fun. I got to know about A-Frame and Three.JS... and idk what I used, I just used the GBL files from Sketchfab ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. It was my first 3D site so not much is 3D here. I just faked 3D looks on the title fonts, and the rest was my knowledge of static sites. In future, I plan to make fully 3D site. The only other place I have used 3D design was MS Paint 3D, and it was for some... not so appropriate modelling to show off to my friends.

## The rough part ‚Äî Animating the 3D model¬° üéä
> Added a new pain in the end: I tried to add another faking 3D style (its a image card), and this thing got the best of me ‚Äí for some frikin' reason it wouldn't take local files as image sources so I had to upload to imgbb.com and made a lot of commits in the end and pushed just to see if the final product looked like it should. Ugh.

> It was pain to try to animate this, like from setting the scene with lighting to transitioning to a new place with new view-angles, though it was my first time learning this (and feeding my JS knowledge), so the pain was obvious. Had fun designing the static part of it though.
